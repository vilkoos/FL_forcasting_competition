## activity 1 - submission to a forecasting competition.

According to the competition description:

We provide you with twenty years of monthly data on the global mean sea level. The data gives the change in global mean sea level relative to the measurement for January 1995. Your task is to predict the global mean sea level for January 2015 to June 2018.

My predictions and their results are in this [notebook](Forcasting_competition.ipynb)
